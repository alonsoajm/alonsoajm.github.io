## Welcome to my website!

I'm an assistant professor of economics at the University of Cantabria.

My research lies in Economics, but also incorporates insights from Management and Public Administration. In particular, my research interests include public service performance and public sector reform, with an emphasis on privatization, marketization and decentralization. I have recently published in international peer-reviewed journals including Strategic Management Journal, World Development and Public Administration, among others.
